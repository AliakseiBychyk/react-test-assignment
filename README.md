## The Powerpuff Girls - React Application

This project has been created as React.js test assignment.

The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).


As soon as you clone the project, don't forget to install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Then you can simply run the app with:

```
npm start
```

The App will run on `http://localhost:3000`.


Technology stack applied in the project:
- React.js
- Create React App - bootstrap
- React Router
- ESlint
- SASS

And I have used ES6+ JS as much as I can.
